# Starbound & Mumble Server instructions.

## Access the VPN.

Instructions for accessing my Starbound Server and Mumble server.

1. Download DynVPN from https://www.dynvpn.com/download/
2. Talk to me in my channel: http://www.twitch.tv/edge226
3. I generate a code and give it to you via a twitch PM.
4. Enter the code into the DynVPN Software.
5. You can now connect to the Starbound and Mumble server.


## Voice Chat.
I use Mumble and set up a server so we can talk while we play. Please use it as well.

### Vital mumble settings.
1. Use push to talk and set an uncommon key. Left Alt is probably a good one.
2. [Attenuate](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e2rm88p0ts9e45q/Mumble%20Configuration_018.png?dl=0) while you talk but not others. This turns your game down when you talk so it does not bleed through into the Stream.
3. Turn off Text to Speech notifications. They may be nice but I do not want it bleeding into the Voice Stream.
